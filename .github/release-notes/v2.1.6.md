# v2.1.6 — 2025-11-04

## Added

- Accessory Information (Manufacturer/Model/Serial/Firmware) set for all sensors to improve HAP compliance.
- Wind speed and wind direction exposed as numeric values using LightSensor services (values shown in Home; units label is lux due to HomeKit limitations).

## Docs

- README: clarify that sensors are bridged under the Homebridge bridge (don’t add them individually in the Home app).
- README: document Home app limitations and the intentional unit mismatch used to display numbers (pressure on CO₂, wind on Light sensors).

## Full Changelog

- [v2.1.5...v2.1.6](https://github.com/TommasoCere/homebridge-weatherxm/compare/v2.1.5...v2.1.6)
