# v2.1.7 — 2025-11-04

## Changed

- Removed wind yes/no (MotionSensor) accessory; wind is now exposed only as numeric speed and direction.
- Refresh interval now respects the monthly cap pro‑rata: when starting mid‑month, the plugin spreads the remaining allowance over the remaining time in the current month (assumes earlier tokens are already spent). Minimum of 1 call preserved.
